Eva and I consulted each other first on this assignment and worked together on it on 2/11, and then throughout the rest of the week.

Both Eva and I attended TA hours on Sunday 2/12 at 1pm. We used the resource (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69083518/how-to-pick-random-element-from-2d-string-array-in-java) to retrieve a random string from the canned_responses list. We also used (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71505537/java-chatbot-mirroring-and-canned-responses) to start figuring out how to do the canned responses, but the code we made was our own. 

I attended TA hours on Monday 2/13 - fixed while loop glitch by using .equals and 
We attended TA hours on Tuesday 2/14. And then again on Wednesday 2/15.

On Tuesday, Angelica (Angie) and I went over each others code, I fixed my canned responses then because they weren't working properly.
On Wednesday, I also spoke with Bintu about our code. My canned responses broke again for a bit so we retraced our steps there and I helped her out with her code. 

Some parts of Java is similar to Python, but the way we use classes is really different because basically no code can exist without referencing classes. We knew what we had to implement based on what we learned in Python, but implementing it with the right syntax was pretty hard. Also, I learned that java brackets are really important to keep track of, so while you may not need indentations to make the code work, it will make it a lot easier to debug your program (which we had to do a lot during this project).

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    What I learned about programming in general through this assignment is that every language that has the functions based on its paradigms. For example, loops are shared between Python and Java, and is pretty much necessary for running a lot of programs efficiently. Also, lists are very useful in any language, because they make the code a lot less clunky and cluttered and makes it easier to store information.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    What worked really well during this assignment was using booleans to allow the program to 1) identify words that needed to be mirrored in the user's response using mirror words (if, else statements were really helpful there too) and 2) deciding whether or not the user's response had to be mirrored in the first place, upon which, the program would tell itself to do so or it would tell itself that it can just give a canned response based on true/false statements.
